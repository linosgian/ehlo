# What?

In an attempt to take (some) of my data back from the "cloud", and learn
something along the way, I decided to gather all my photos and my family's photos,
scattered around in old HDDs, flash drives or random "cloud" providers, and host
them in my own hardware at home.

# Why?

It seems that it might be too late to gain back some control over what data is
being collected by big corporations, how that data is manipulated and resold. They
are usually used for targeted advertising, profiling, and often serve as the basis to
develop other products. As an example, a [story](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18564043/photo-storage-app-ever-facial-recognition-secretly-trained-ai) popped up a while ago
about a startup called `Ever.ai`, regarding a privacy violation. 
The company was providing "free" storage for
their users' photos. What they did not clearly state in their privacy policy was
that they used these photos to train a facial recognition model, which they sold
to anyone buying, like governments, military or banks.

As it turns out, this company even rebranded in an attempt to disassociate
themselves from the privacy violation, from `Ever AI` to `Paravision`, and they
continued to sell their facial recognition product.

>Historically, Chinese and Russian face recognition has been more accurate at recognizing global
faces than offerings from American companies. We believe that it is imperative for companies like
ours to do more to ensure the United States does not fall behind in the global marketplace.
Achieving the #1 rank in the world clearly shows that there is an American company capable of
competing with and beating any global competitor in the development of this critical AI technology,"
states Charlie Rice, CTO of Paravision.

Unfortunately what I describe above, is the norm nowadays. We've ended up with a
bunch of corporations dictating the terms for how people express themselves, how
they are having fun, how they form their opinions on important matters.
They have created platforms that exploit humans'
need for exposure and validation from others. They provide people's daily dose
of endorphins when others like their post or retweet them.

Sadly, I don't think that people are not informed enough to care, they simply
turn to arguments like:

- I have nothing to hide
- I am okay with what they are doing, as long as I can use their services for free
- This is how things are, resisting is futile.
- Yeah, the situation is bad but oh well, what can ***I*** do? I am only a
    single of the X platform.

# Disclaimer #1

I don't have the delusion that capitalism will fall if we get our
photos out of Google Photos, or frankly by doing anything software-related for
that matter. The issue I am trying to raise here is much bigger.
What I am trying to say is that people, time and time again forget the power they have,
and how it's becoming harder and harder to resist with social cohesion and not
as a sparse group of people that can easily get targeted and be marginalised.
IMHO this issue is true everywhere, ranging from getting control of our data online,
to speaking out and when we see an injustice happening around us.

------------

# Disclaimer #2

I have gone overboard in some aspects (e.g. using a single-node Nomad deployment),
and some things are an overkill for what I needed to do.
The goal was to learn some things too. Also, I am still
learning a bunch about the technologies used, hence you'll notice mistakes or
omissions.

# Hardware

Starting with the hardware I've got for this endeavour:

- 2x4TB WD RED NAS - these will hold anything important (e.g. photos)
- 1x2TB WD BLUE - mostly for ephemeral content (e.g. downloaded torrents)
- Asus Prime B450M-A
- AMD Ryzen 3 1200 Box
- Thermaltake Core X2
- Corsair RMi Series RM650i (bought this from a friend, quite cheap)
- 1x16GB DDR4 16GB PC 3000 G.Skill Aegis
- TP-LINK TL-SG1005D v8 - unmanaged gigabit switch

Once I assembled the hardware, I installed Debian Buster on it, copied over my
SSH key and started configuring the host. Soon after I was greeted with a weird bug.

## The occasional random freeze

When the CPU was mostly idle, the host was freezing. My SSH session was hanging
and kernel's logs were littered with lines like the following:

`NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#12 stuck for 23s! [DOM Worker:1364]`

After looking up the issue, I was convinced it had to do with the CPU's
[C6 states](https://www.dell.com/support/article/gr/el/grbsdt1/qna41893/what-is-the-c-state?lang=en) not working as expected. The CPU is in the `C0` state when it's fully
operational. On the `C6` state, also known as `Deep Power Down`, the CPU reduces
its internal voltage to any value, even 0V. C6 states were introduced for power
saving purposes. It was apparent, that when the CPU was going through the `C`
states, the system hang was triggering.

The fix was easy enough: toggling off the low power features of the CPU in
my motherboard's BIOS. As a side note, this of course has the downside that
those power saving features are not utilized, but I will revisit the issue later
on.


# ZFS

In order to provide some level of redundancy, I've setup a
single vdev in mirror mode, using the 2x4TB WD RED drives. 
This pool is intended for anything important, e.g. photos/videos.
```

root@ntoulapa# zpool list -v -P -H
tank    3.62T   111G    3.52T   -       -       0%      2%      1.00x   ONLINE  -
        mirror  3.62T   111G    3.52T   -       -       0%      2.97%   -       ONLINE
        /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K0LNLCDF-part1  -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       ONLINE
        /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFRX-68N32N0_WD-WCC7K3THY50S-part1  -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       ONLINE
```


# DNS

I used [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) to circumvent censorships, block ads, avoid having my 
ISP log/inspect my DNS requests (yeah, my ISP can still deduce which services 
I'm using through metadata like the destination IP, but oh well).
Since I already own `lgian.com`, I thought that it would be convenient to setup
all services as subdomains. I defined some so-called [cloaking rules](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Cloaking),
which is basically the equivalent of `/etc/hosts`, with a couple of added
features (e.g. wildcard domains):

```

# lgian â†’ cat cloaking-rules.txt
*.lgian.com 192.168.1.3
```

This way, devices don't have to go through public DNS infrastructure asking for
`*.lgian.com` subdomains and so `dnscrypt-proxy` will return the response
immediately.

At this point, one would say that I could have used a non-existent domain (e.g.
the `.lan` tld) but doing it this way enabled me to have a valid certificate for
all services (aka subdomains) for free, thanks to Let's Encrypt's wildcard
certificates!


# Architecture

Services run in Docker containers, mostly because I've heard that orchestrating
containers is easy nowadays and I would encounter no issues whatsoever. In all seriousness, I
wanted to easily spin up a new service, test it and possibly throw it away. Also,
I wanted to isolate/limit their resource usage. In a totally non-scientific way, I chose
[Nomad](https://nomadproject.io/) for that purpose. It goes without saying that Hashicorp shoved all of its
other products on me (call me Consul or Vault).

The software stack looks like this:

- Ansible: deploy everything, from my `.vimrc` up to Nomad and the services
    themselves.
- Nomad: Orchestrates the deployment and management of all services.
- Traefik: Reverse proxy (also terminates TLS, and auto-renews my wildcard LE
    certificate)
- Consul: Handles service discovery. Also integrates with Traefik by
    automatically setting up routing rules for each new service
- Vault: Secrets management :shrug:
- node-exporter + Cadvisor + smartmon.sh for metrics
- Prometheus + Alertmanager consume the metrics ^
- Grafana for visualization
- Restic+B2: Periodically send full (encrypted) backups to Backblaze
- ZFS: A simple mirrored vdev using the 2x4TB WD RED NAS drives
- dnscrypt-proxy: Block ads and use DoH (cheers [libreops.cc](https://libreops.cc/))

## Services

For each service running on top of Nomad, we only have to define a job file
written in HCL - Hashicorp's configuration language (fully compatible with JSON,
but can also contain comments and so on).

An example looks like the following:
```
job "photoprism" {
  type = "service"
  group "photoprism" {
    count = 1
    restart {
      attempts = 2
      interval = "30m"
      delay = "15s"
      mode = "fail"
    }
    task "photoprism-docker" {
      driver = "docker"
      env {
        PHOTOPRISM_TITLE = "OK"
        PHOTOPRISM_SUBTITLE = "Doy"
        PHOTOPRISM_DEBUG = "false"
        ...
      }
      config {
        image = "photoprism/photoprism:20200204"
        network_mode = "bridge"
        port_map = {
          photoprismui = 2342
        }
        volumes = [
          "/photoprism-cache:/home/photoprism/.cache/photoprism",
          "/photoprism-db:/home/photoprism/.local/share/photoprism/resources/database",
        ]
        labels {
          group = "photos"
        }
      }
      resources {
        network {
          port "photoprismui" {}
        }
        cpu = 500
        memory = 3072
      }
      service {
        name = "photos"
        tags = ["photos"]
        address_mode = "driver"
        port = "photoprismui"
        check {
          name     = "alive"
          type     = "tcp"
          port     = "photoprismui"
          interval = "15s"
          timeout  = "5s"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

The most important parameter here is the "driver", it basically defines what
kind of workload we want to run. Nomad is able to handle VMs, Docker, LXCs, rkt, and so
on.

In our example, a docker container is configured, just as you would without
Nomad (volumes, networking, images etc.). Also, the resources "stanza"
defines what we need in terms of bandwidth, CPU time, memory and so on. Lastly,
in the "service" stanza we define, which ports we want to expose, and some basic
healthchecks, in order for Consul to verify that the service is up and running.

Once the job is started, Consul will register the service and let Traefik pick
it up.

```
# lgian@ntoulapa[~] â†’ consul catalog services
cadvisor
dnscrypt-proxy
exporter
grafana
lb
photos
...
```

## Traefik

Traefik, has the concept of `frontends` and `backends`. `frontends` are rules by
which Traefik knows to route traffic to the right `backend` as shown below:

{{< figure src="/traefik.jpg" title="Traefik Architecture" caption="Traefik Architecture" >}}

Consul knows which ports should be exposed for each service, and also as shown
above, we have given a name to every service through the nomad job file. Hence Traefik knows how to route
traffic to the correct `backend`.

The last piece of the puzzle is the following line in Traefik's config:

```
[consulCatalog]
domain = "lgian.com"
```
Where we define the base domain out of which Traefik will derive frontend rules.

In our case, Traefik automatically sets up a `Host`-based `frontend` rule for each service based on
the service name we've given it. An example follows:
```

job "transmission" {
...
  "service" {
    "name": "torrents"
  }
...
```
If the request's `Host` header is as follows `Host: torrents.lgian.com`, then it
will be routed correctly.

NOTE: The `Host` header is automatically injected by browsers when we type in
a hostname, e.g. `torrents.lgian.com`.


### TLS certificates

Traefik has the ability to generate (and auto-renew) Let's Encrypt(LE) certificates,
through HTTP and DNS challenges. Since I am doing this in my home's NAT'ed
network, I would have to go through the trouble of
port forwarding the traffic, and solve LE's HTTP challenge, and I might not be able to
do all of this, since my ISP's router is already running the management service
on ports 80 and 443 (on all interfaces), so that they can push updates, restart my router etc...

DNS challenges came to the rescue here. In order to prove ownership of the DNS
domain, one has to push a new `TXT` record containing a challenge string, sent to
you by LE. The thing is, your DNS provider has to have an API for you to push
such updates. I've bought my domain from [`Papaki`](https://www.papaki.com/en), and they currently don't
support this. Therefore, I switch to DigitalOcean's DNS servers for my domain.

Traefik already supports DigitalOcean's API:

```
# lgian â†’ cat traefik.toml
[acme]
storage = "acme.json"
acmeLogging = true
onHostRule = true

[acme.dnsChallenge]
    provider = "digitalocean"

[[acme.domains]]
    main = "*.lgian.com"
```

I opted for a wildcard certificate `*.lgian.com`, to cover any kind of existing
or future service/subdomain. All I had to do here, is to provide Traefik with an
API token for DigitalOcean:

```

# lgian â†’ cat traefik.nomad.j2
job "traefik" {
  vault {
    policies = ["traefik"]
  }
  ...
      template {
        {% raw %}
        data = <<EOF
DO_AUTH_TOKEN="{{with secret "kv/data/do/api"}}{{.Data.data.key}}{{end}}"
EOF
        {% endraw %}
        destination = "secrets/file.env"
        env = true
      }
```

First, I give access to the Nomad's client on Vault (it basically generates a token with the
"traefik" policy on it). Second, when we run the job, the secret is pulled from
Vault, and the it's injected in the job's environment for Traefik to use.

## Monitoring

Although none of the services I'm running are critical, except for the health of
the ZFS pool and the encrypted backups on Backblaze, I've setup some basic monitoring
infrastructure.

### Metrics

- [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): Basic host metrics (e.g. kernel statistics, network, CPU, RAM,
    etc.)
- [smartmon.sh](https://github.com/prometheus-community/node-exporter-textfile-collector-scripts/blob/f76c400c5e1036bfb230f4cb4448fcac3701924f/smartmon.sh): A script wrapping `smartctl` and exposes [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.) statistics for
    node-exporter.
- [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor): per-container metrics

### Prometheus

Prometheus features a time-series database that consumes all of the
aforementioned metrics. Prometheus provides a query language called PromQL
in order to construct complex queries and setup alerting based on them.
Although you can setup alerts, Prometheus does not handle aggregation, ignoring
alerts, sending notifications and so on. For that purpose, `alertmanager` can be
utilized.

### Grafana

For visualization, I used Grafana alongside several standard dashboards:

- One for monitoring the ZFS pool
- The popular `node-exporter` one, containing all the important metrics for the
    host.
- A `cAdvisor` specific for a per-container metrics
- One for S.M.A.R.T stats, concerning my disks' health

## Backups

As stated above, I use [restic](https://restic.net/) to ensure that no data is
going to get lost, in case I mess up or lose both my drives during resilvering.
For the volume of data I have at the moment, [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/)
seemed like a reasonable choice. All I had to do was setup a [batch](https://nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers/#batch)
Nomad job. I could just setup a cronjob, but I did it this way for the same reason I ran
`node_exporter` in a docker container: uniformity. I keep everything running on
the host (except for Vault and Consul) as Nomad jobs.

I've included the Nomad job and the accompanying bash script in the Appendix
below


# Usecases

How am I making good use of this setup?

## Syncing and viewing Photos

So my main objective was to streamline how I backup and view my photos. To begin
with, I setup all my devices to sync every time I get home using Nextcloud (it
uses the ZFS pool for storage). From there, I use
[photoprism](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/) to index, label and view my photos.
Lastly, `restic` is used to incrementally create full encrypted backups to Backblaze.

## Stream videos

Another use-case was the typical video streaming gig. Since I have a central
location that I want to download and stream videos from, I opted for Plex and so
far I am quite satisfied. It syncs my progress (so I can switch between devices
seamlessly), automatically scans for new content, downloads subtitles and most
importantly, I've had no issues streaming even through WiFi (5Ghz).
